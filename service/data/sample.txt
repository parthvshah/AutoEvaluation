What is multi-stage download?
Multistage download fixes the problem which is the speed at which pages download. This method ensures that the most basic functionality is loaded into a page initially. The page then begins to download other components that should appear on the page. Now, if the user leaves the page before all the components are loaded, there is no consequence. However, even if the user stays on thee page for an extended period of time, there is no consequence, as in that time, all the components of the page would have loaded. The advantage of this method is that is that the developer gets to decide what is downloaded at what point of time. The disadvantage may be that it leads to slower download time.
